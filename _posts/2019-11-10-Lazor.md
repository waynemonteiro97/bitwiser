Here we will attempt to solve the toughest boards you dare to throw at us with our humble yet efficient code.

If you're having trouble solving a particular board, dont worry, just get it into a .bff file. / The .bff file should contain:

Comments that help you understand the contents of the file
The position of blocks and empty movable positions in a grid form
Number and types of blocks where: A - fixed reflect block B - fixed opaque block C - fixed refract block
Laser coordinates (origin and direction) - L
Hole/sink coordinates - P
Once you've made your .bff file use the (insert final file name here) to solve it. Insert the file name in line (insert line number here).

The way the code solves a particular board is as such:

We designed a grid for a given board, with each block in the board being a middle point on the block in a grid (like a block surrounded by x's).
x x x
x o x
x x x
This is one block of the grid portraying one block of the board.

The Block function in the class Grid will create a random permutation of the available blocks and movable spaces in the grid and give this permuation to the lazor_path function to solve it. The axes are : horizontal direction is the x axis and vertical deriction is the y axis. The lazor_path checks if for the the given placement of blocks all the lazors hit all the sinks/ holes or not. As soon as it comes across the right grid,the simulation stops and it prints out the correct grid which is the solution to the board.

For visual appeal we generated a GUI image (which will be saved in the same directory along with a txt file called solution_textfile.txt with the same information) for the solution where: dark grey blocks as - empty positions (o's) white blocks as - reflect blocks (A's) black blocks as - absorb blocks (B's) cyan blocks as - refract blocks (C's)

Your board should be solved in a maximum of 2 min. Bigger or more complicated boards take longer time. Have fun cheater! (no offense!)
